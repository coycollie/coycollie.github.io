<p>My name is coycollie. I'm a front-end web developer, and I've been coding since 2013. I graduated in 2019 from Rutgers University with a degree in information technology. I have a full-time job and don't freelance. Apart from making websites, I love language, zoology, history, drawing, psychology, anime, and true crime. As a Cuban-born US citizen, I'm fluent in Spanish and English. I've studied German since middle school and French since high school. I'm also studying Polish and Italian. I have the best parents ever, and my birds and my partner are my happiness!&nbsp;â™¡</p>
<p>Some more trivia about me: I'm an atheist. I'm very reserved and anxious and have mild social anxiety. I'm quite conscientious. I love edgy humor. I value logic, love, loyalty, being a free-thinker, and being myself. I'm enamored with characters who are outcasts, love-obsessed, or cartoonishly evil because I see myself in them. I love all bugs and animals, but my favorites are birds, toads, frogs, canids, shrews, moles, rats, and mice. My two fursonas are a chocolate brown coydog and a pastel pink mouse. My favorite color is pink. Some other things I like are coffee, sweets, beanie babies, sunshine, and rainbows. Loren is my gender-neutral alias. I'm a monogamous bi/omni nonbinary woman with a phallosexual preference.</p>
